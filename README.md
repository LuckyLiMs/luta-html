Luta-HTML is a small project I made following a YouTube tutorial of Chris Courses with the intention of helping the learning of basics HTML, CSS and JAVA SCRIPT by making a cool game.
The idea was introduced by a friend in the class who was showing a tutorial link of a portuguese guy who has made the tutorial for this same game, we were stuned by the idea of making games using HTML, thinking that we coud make our game ideas, but after that, Iv'e made that tutorial and it was incomplete, so it was never completed and the idea never stood up.

but by the time pass by, I met with another friend who was stuned by the idea of making games on HTML as well, and the thing now is that he was following tutorials on YouTube of Chris Courses, just the guy that has made that same tutorial of the portuguese, but complete. Then I was again following the tutorial and finaly finished the process, the time that passed by the begining of the idea to the finished progect it is some months, but is finaly over and now the idea it is make a character selector and add music to this.
